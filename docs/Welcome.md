# Welcome to Wrtr! üñãÔ∏è

Welcome to Wrtr, the terminal-based writing app that puts the "terminal" in "terminal velocity of productivity." Who needs bloated word processors when you have pure, distraction-free text?

## What is Wrtr?
Wrtr is your minimalist, markdown-obsessed writing buddy. Think of it as a typewriter that went to coding bootcamp and came back speaking fluent keyboard shortcuts.

## Why Choose the Terminal Life?
- **Zero distractions**: No popup notifications asking if you want to upgrade to Premium
- **Keyboard ninja mode**: Your mouse can finally take a well-deserved break
- **Markdown mastery**: Because `**bold**` is way cooler than clicking a button
- **Auto-save magic**: Never lose work again (your past self will thank you)

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Press `N`** on the home screen - boom, new file! 
2. Start typing your masterpiece
3. **Hit `Ctrl+S`** to save (or let auto-save handle it like the responsible adult it is)
4. **Press `Ctrl+F`** when you inevitably forget where you put that brilliant sentence

## Essential Survival Keys
- **`Tab`**: Hop between panes like a caffeinated kangaroo
- **`Ctrl+T`**: Toggle file browser (when you need to find your files hiding in folders)
- **`r`**: Rename files in the browser (because "untitled.md" gets old fast)
- **`Escape`**: Your panic button - gets you back to safety

## Fun Fact
Wrtr uses RapidFuzz for search, which is basically like having a really smart autocomplete that actually reads your mind. Almost scary, but in a good way.

Happy writing! May your words flow faster than your coffee consumption. ‚òï
